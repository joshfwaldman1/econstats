    "explanation": "OPHNFB (nonfarm business sector output per hour) is the primary measure of labor productivity, showing how much output workers produce per hour worked. PRS85006092 (nonfarm business unit labor costs) provides the complementary view - when productivity rises, unit labor costs typically fall, making this pair essential for comprehensive productivity analysis. These are the key metrics economists use to assess whether the economy is becoming more efficient at producing goods and services."

    "explanation": "Economic contraction is measured by negative real GDP growth rates. A191RL1Q225SBEA shows the quarterly annualized real GDP growth rate - when this turns negative, the economy is contracting. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth is the traditional definition of recession. This series is already a growth rate so no YoY calculation is needed."

The CFNAI is particularly valuable for momentum analysis as positive values indicate above-trend growth while negative values suggest below-trend growth.

Both are in the same units (billions of chained 2017 dollars), allowing for accurate percentage calculation. Consumer spending typically represents about 70% of US GDP, making this ratio a key indicator of the economy's consumption dependence. The separate charts will show the levels of each component, and the ratio can be calculated by dividing PCE by GDP."
