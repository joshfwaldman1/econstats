This demographic-specific series shows how the most educated segment of the workforce fares in the job market. Year-over-year changes help identify trends in demand for college-educated workers and whether economic conditions are affecting this group differently than others."

I'm also including LNS14027659 (less than high school) and LNS14027689 (bachelor's degree and higher) for comparison to show how unemployment varies by educational attainment. This gives you the full picture of how high school graduates fare in the labor market relative to those with less and more education."

Lower unemployment rates indicate better employment outcomes. This shows the clear education premium in the labor market - higher education typically correlates with lower unemployment rates.

These demographic-specific series allow direct comparison of unemployment rates across racial groups to identify disparities. The combined chart will clearly show the persistent gaps between groups, with Black unemployment typically running significantly higher than White unemployment, and Hispanic unemployment generally falling between the two. This is the standard approach for measuring racial labor market disparities."

    "explanation": "I don't have access to the specific wage/earnings series needed to analyze the gender pay gap. The gender pay gap requires comparing median weekly earnings or hourly wages between men and women, typically measured by series like 'Median weekly earnings - Women' vs 'Median weekly earnings - Men' from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The series I have access to focus on employment rates, labor force participation, and unemployment rates by demographic groups, but not compensation data. To properly analyze the gender pay gap, you would need BLS series that track earnings by gender, such as those from the Current Population Survey's earnings data."

LNS12300060 (employment-population ratio) is the most comprehensive measure showing the share actually working. LNS11300060 (labor force participation rate) shows engagement with the job market. LNS14000025 (unemployment rate for 25-54) shows joblessness among this group.

LNS11300060 shows labor force participation rate for ages 25-54, LNS12300060 shows the employment-population ratio for this group (the best single measure of labor market health), and LNS14000060 captures unemployment rate for prime-age workers. This age group excludes students and early retirees, giving the clearest picture of actual working-age labor market conditions."
