    "explanation": "Two views of the trade deficit: NETEXP shows net exports from the GDP accounts (real, quarterly), while BOPGSTB shows the goods and services trade balance from balance of payments data (nominal, monthly). Negative values indicate a deficit - the U.S. imports more than it exports. Large deficits can drag on GDP growth."

    "explanation": "BOPGSTB is the monthly trade balance (goods and services) from balance of payments data - the most timely trade indicator. NETEXP is quarterly net exports from GDP accounts.
