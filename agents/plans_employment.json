    "explanation": "The Sahm Rule (SAHMREALTIME) is a real-time recession indicator created by economist Claudia Sahm. It triggers when the 3-month moving average of unemployment rises 0.5 percentage points or more above its low from the prior 12 months. When SAHMREALTIME crosses above 0.5, it signals a recession has likely begun. Shown alongside unemployment rate for context."

    "combine_chart": false,
    "explanation": "The Sahm Rule recession indicator triggers when it rises above 0.5 (shown by benchmark line). This happens when unemployment rises sufficiently fast - specifically when the 3-month average unemployment rate exceeds its 12-month low by 0.5 percentage points or more. It has accurately identified every recession since 1970 with no false positives."

    "explanation": "Initial Claims (ICSA) shows new unemployment filings each week - the most timely indicator of layoffs. Continuing Claims (CCSA) shows ongoing claims - how many remain unemployed. Together they provide a real-time view of labor market stress. Spikes in initial claims often signal recession onset."

    "explanation": "Initial unemployment claims (ICSA) measure new filings for unemployment benefits - the timeliest labor market indicator. Continuing claims (CCSA) show how many people remain on unemployment. Rising claims signal weakening labor market; falling claims indicate improvement."
