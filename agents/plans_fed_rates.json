While r* itself isn't directly observable, we can assess Fed policy stance by comparing the current fed funds rate (FEDFUNDS) to longer-term rates like the 10-year Treasury (DGS10). When the fed funds rate is well below long-term rates, policy is likely accommodative relative to r*. When it's at or above long-term rates, policy may be at or above the neutral rate.
