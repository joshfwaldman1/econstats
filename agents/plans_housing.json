These indicators show how long it would take to sell current inventory at the current sales pace. Lower months' supply indicates tight inventory (seller's market), while higher supply indicates looser inventory (buyer's market).

The Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (CSUSHPINSA) with year-over-year changes will show price appreciation turning negative during crashes like 2008-2012. Housing starts (HOUST) reveal construction activity collapse as builders halt projects.

The rental vacancy rate shows the percentage of rental housing units that are vacant and available for rent, while the homeowner vacancy rate shows the percentage of homeowner housing units that are vacant and for sale. Both are quarterly data and combining them provides a complete picture of housing market tightness across both rental and ownership markets. Lower vacancy rates indicate tighter housing supply, while higher rates suggest more available housing stock."
