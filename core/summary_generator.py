"""
Summary Generator for EconStats.

This module generates analytical (not just descriptive) economic summaries.
The key insight: good economic analysis focuses on the "why" and "what's next",
not just the "what".

Bad summary: "CPI is 2.7%, down from 9% peak"
Good summary: "Inflation has fallen sharply but the last mile to 2% is proving
              difficult. Shelter (4.6%) is the main holdout - it lags rate hikes
              by 18-24 months, so relief should come by mid-2025. Goods are
              deflating (-1.2%), helping offset sticky services."

Key principles:
1. Lead with the insight, not the number
2. Explain causation and lags (Fed policy takes 12-18 months to hit inflation)
3. Note conflicting signals when they exist
4. End with a forward-looking statement

- GOODS PRICES: Are they falling? That helps offset sticky service prices
- FED REACTION: What does this mean for interest rates?
- WHAT'S NEXT: When does inflation get back to 2%? What could go wrong?

Main point: Getting from 3% to 2% inflation is harder than getting from 9% to 3%. Explain why.""",

- EARLY vs LATE SIGNALS: Job openings and quits drop first. Unemployment rises last.
- COOLING vs CRASHING: Is this a healthy slowdown from the 2022 frenzy, or something worse?
- WAGES: Are raises feeding into higher prices?
- WHAT'S NEXT: What does this mean for Fed rate cuts? Can we avoid a recession?

Main point: Different job market numbers tell different stories - explain which ones matter most.""",

- MIXED SIGNALS: Some things say recession (yield curve), others say no (jobs, spending)
- HISTORY: How does this compare to past pre-recession periods?

- CAN PEOPLE AFFORD IT: How do mortgage rates + home prices affect monthly payments?
- WHY NO ONE IS SELLING: People with 3% mortgages won't sell to get a 7% one
